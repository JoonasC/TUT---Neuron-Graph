*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
- To visualize the graph you need a json file, which contains all the neurons and links between them.
- To open a graph make sure the file you want to open is in the graphs folder in the same directory as the files, and then click on "Open a graph" and type the name of the json file in the box that pops up.
- When the graph is shown you can pan around by dragging the the graph and zoom using the zoom slider.
- Putting your mouse on a link will highlight that link and show the connections that link represents.
- Clicking on a neuron will highlight all the links that connect to that neuron.
- Hovering over a neuron will show the name of that neuron.
